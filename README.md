# DnD_DiceRoller
Do you hate rolling tons of die during your DnD sessions? Here's a unity project to solve that! From d4s to d20s and anywhere in between.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the Unity engine in order to run this program.

```
Windows and Mac:
https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download

Linux:
https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/page-2
```

### Installing

Once Unity has been downloaded, follow the instructions to install it to your machine.
Then clone this repository into a desired location. Following this, open Unity and open a project in it, specifying the folder you downloaded this repository to.
To run the program, once it is open, hit the play button at the top. This will start the simulation for rolling your die. To actualy roll the die, simply click with your mouse.


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Travis will be used to automatically check the code, mainly C#, to see if it is linted and formatted correctly.
