# DnD_DiceRoller

Do you hate rolling tons of die during your DnD sessions? Here's a unity project to solve that! From d4s to d20s and anywhere in between.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Nothing required to run the application.

You will need to have the Unity engine in order to do any development this program.

    Windows and Mac:
    https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download

    Linux:

### Installing

DEVELOPMENT WAY:

Once Unity has been downloaded, follow the instructions to install it to your machine.
Then clone this repository into a desired location. Following this, open Unity and open a project in it, specifying the folder you downloaded this repository to.
To run the program, once it is open, hit the play button at the top. This will start the simulation for rolling your die. To actualy roll the die, simply click with your mouse.

SIMPLE RUNNABLE WAY:

Simply click on the DnD_DiceRollerRun.x86_64 file and select the desired application settings.
This program has a lot of rendering that needs to be done initially and so the set up process takes quite a while (you may have to click on a keep waiting message for Unity to respond). Once running, click your mouse to roll the die.

## Running the tests

Travis will be used to automatically check this project, mainly markdown files, to see if it is linted and formatted correctly.

## Deployment

This is ready to be run on Linux systems with the DnD_DiceRollerRun.x86_64

To be deployed on other platforms (Windows, MacOS, etc.), one must create builds in the Unity editor.
Due to errors given on my machine via Unity, I cannot create Windows or Mac runnables at this time.
I apologize for the inconvenience.
